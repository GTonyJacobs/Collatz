# Trajectory Statitics
We can calculate a trajectory for any number we like, but how to trajectories behave, overall? How extreme to they get, and what does a "typical" trajectory look like? These questions can be answered, numerically and visually, in various ways.

## Length
One of the most obvious features of a trajectory is its length. Some numbers reach 1 in realtively few steps, and other seem to wander around for a long time first.
